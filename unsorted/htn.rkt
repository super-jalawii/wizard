;; Task Hierarchies are called domains.

;; A domain is basically a graph. There's a designated top-level node that we
;; use as a starting point, and then we do a depth first search to try and find
;; a valid plan based on the current world state and the preconditions
;; associated with each task.

;; Methods are lists of tasks - evaluated in order. This can still be
;; represented in the graph. So if we reimagine the HTN as a graph, and work on
;; inserting specific types of nodes and edges, and then define a method of
;; traversal (this is where we check preconditions and apply effects), we should
;; end up with a functioning HTN.

















;; FIXME: This doesn't work right now - it's not important yet, so moving on.
