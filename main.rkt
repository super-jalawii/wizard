From the Inform Recipe Book:

A road is a kind of room. Definition: A room is offroad if it is not a road.

Instead of going by a vehicle (called the auto) to somewhere offroad:
    say "You can't drive [the auto] off-road."

Frafalgar Square is a road. "The Square is overlooked by a pillared statue of
Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson (no relation), naval hero and convenience to pigeons
since 1812."

The National Gallery is north of Trafalgar Square. The Strand is east of
Trafalgar Square. The Strand is a road.

The car is a vehicle in Trafalgar Square. The ignition is a device. The ignition
is part of the car.

Instead of going by the car when the ignition is switched off:
    say "The ignition is off at the moment."

Instead of switching on the car, try switching on the ignition.
Instead of switching off the car, try switching off the ignition.

;; Actions ... are kind of weird for us right now. They're like rules. But they
;; have explicit phases, and order matters (which is a problem for our rule
;; system right now).

;; An additional thing to consider is that rules seem to have contextual
;; predicates which must be true for the rule to even execute. For instance, in
;; the above text there is a rule which only applies when the action is "going",
;; and the first and second nouns are "vehicle" and "somewhere offroad".

;; These feel somewhat like match statements or other destructuring forms - the
;; rule is actually something like:

;; (going vehicle somewhere-offroad)

;; In this case, vehicle and somewhere-offroad are themselves predicates which
;; would be matched against the more specific action taken by the player.

;; The key will be figuring out what the most specific rule is. Do we only
;; perform the most specific rule?
